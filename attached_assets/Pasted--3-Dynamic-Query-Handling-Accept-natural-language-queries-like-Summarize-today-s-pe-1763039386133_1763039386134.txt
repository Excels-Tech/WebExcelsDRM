
3. **Dynamic Query Handling**:
- Accept natural language queries like:
  - “Summarize today’s performance”
  - “Which tasks are overdue?”
  - “Which leads need follow-up?”
  - “What did I miss yesterday?”
- OR respond to UI-triggered quick prompts like:
  - [Analyze Activity]
  - [Show Top Customers]
  - [Daily Summary]
  - [Pending Verifications]

4. **Strict Boundary Enforcement**:
- Automatically reject unrelated prompts like:
  - “Who is the president of Pakistan?”
  - “What is ChatGPT?”
- Use this standard response:
> "I’m designed to assist only within WebExcels DRM. Please ask something related to your current workspace screen."

🛠️ Technical Stack:

- Use **OpenAI GPT-4 (or GPT-4o)** via provided API key
- Temperature: `0.3` for consistent and deterministic replies
- Max Tokens: `1000`
- Build a lightweight middleware (Node.js or Python Flask) that:
- Detects active screen & role
- Extracts on-screen data into a structured format
- Constructs system prompt + user query
- Sends it to OpenAI API and returns formatted response

💬 Interface Design:

- Floating or docked assistant widget available on **all screens**
- Default UI should auto-generate **smart prompts** based on current screen type
- E.g., On PMS screen: [Show Overdue], [Project Summary]
- On Training: [Which modules pending?], [My Progress]

- Allow typing natural queries or selecting from smart prompt buttons

🔄 Future-Proofing:

- As more modules are added to WebExcels DRM (e.g., HR, Finance, Legal, Procurement, Recruitment, etc.):
- Simply extend screen detection & data capture
- No need to rewrite AI core logic
- Assistant should respond to new screen contexts automatically using the same architecture

📦 Example Use Cases:

- **Dashboard Screen**: “How close am I to my target?”
- **Follow-Up Screen**: “Which customers didn’t reply last week?”
- **Training Module**: “List incomplete trainings”
- **Admin Panel**: “How many users were active last week?”
- **PMS**: “Summarize progress on Project A”
- **Loan Request Screen**: “How many loans are pending approval?”

🔐 API Setup:

- I will provide the OpenAI API key using Replit’s Secrets Manager
- You may securely call OpenAI’s API with `gpt-4` or `gpt-4o` as backend
