Design a responsive web-based application called "WebExcels DRM" (Data Relation Management System) for organizational role-based management and performance tracking.

Start with these modules and UI components based on the CEO's initial demo:

---

🎯 1. **Role-Based Dashboard System (Sales Executive Focus)**

- Create a login-based dashboard where user roles define visibility and access (e.g., Sales Executive, Assistant Manager, Manager, HOD, Admin).
- Top bar shows:
  - Current role (e.g., Sales Executive)
  - Dropdown for time-based sales views: Today (TD), Weekly (WC), Monthly (MN), Quarterly (QT), Yearly (YR)

- Central dashboard cards:
  - Total Customers
  - Contacts Added
  - New Customers
  - Renewals (with expiry countdown)

---

📊 2. **Sales Target & Commission Tracker**

- Design a dynamic target panel showing:
  - Two service types: Alibaba Membership, Value-Added Services (VAS)
  - Monthly, Quarterly, Half-Yearly, and Yearly targets
  - Slab-based commission: e.g., 10% for $1k–$49k, 15% for $50k+, etc.
  - Bonus reward amounts based on achievement

📈 3. **Performance Graphs (Lead Progression)**

  - Leads Added (LE)
  - Qualified Leads (QF)
  - Analyzed Leads (AY)
  - Invoices Sent, Payments Received
  - Memberships Achieved
  - Renewals / Expired / Re-engaged
- Graph is interactive, showing segment-wise breakdowns

📞 4. **Activity Tracker (Time-Logged Reporting)**

- Allow sales execs to log activity types:
  - Call, WhatsApp, Meeting, Email
  - Record time spent per activity (in minutes)
- Generate daily activity reports showing how total working hours are utilized
